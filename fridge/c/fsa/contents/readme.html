#.h2 Usage
#.P   
#For an example of the proper usage of fsm, see the file 
#	<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/c/fsa/contents/fsm_driver.c">fsm_driver.c</a>.
#.P
#    In general, specify the state machine in FILE.fsm and define the
#    action functions in FILE_actions.c. Then run 
#	<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/c/fsa/contents/fsa.awk">fsa.awk</a>
#    compile and link 
#	<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/c/fsa/contents/fsa.c">fsa.c</a>
#	fsm_FILE.c and any driver file. Thats it.
#.P
#    Multiple fsms may be built and run in the same application using the
#    function fsm_allocFsm().  Moreover, calls to fsm() may be nested
#    using the same state machine as long as a different context is used.
#    fsm_allocFsm() returns a context number that must be stored and passed
#    to fsm() on each invoction.  In the provided sample, the context is
#    stored in myContext in test_driver.c.
#.P
#    Fsm() may be called either by polling for events or from inside an
#    interrupt service routine.  If fsm() is called from an interrupt
#    service routine, it must be protected from nested calls using the
#    same context.  Interrupting calls using other contexts is permitted.
#.P
#    Note that the function fsminit() is called only once and should not
#    be called for each fsm.  If there are special requirements for a
#    given fsm, an appropriate init function should be provided and
#    called for that particular fsm.
#.P
#    Currently, fsm traceEnable is set to true and cannot be disbled
#    (without changing fsm_allocFsm()).  An array is maintained within
#    each fsm context wherein each state and event are recorded for each
#    call to fsm().
#
#.H2 DESCRIPTION
#.P
#    Fsm.awk is an awk script designed to read a finite state machine (fsm)
#    specification and produce C files which implement that fsm.  The file 
#    <a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/c/fsa/contents/fsm.c">fsm.c</a>, 
#	included in the distribution, provides the actual state transition
#    function, and the user provides the state transition "action" functions
#    and any special initialization.
#.P
#    The fsm distribution consists mainly of 
#	<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/c/fsa/contents/fsm.awk">fsm.awk</a> and 
#	<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/c/fsa/contents/fsm.c">fsm.c</a>, although
#    there are a number of header files for declarations - doesn't get
#    much simpler than that.
#.P
#    Typically, the fsm specification is named in the form fsm_name.fsm, but 
#    may be named any legal filename.  The action functions may be placed in
#    any number of files by any name the user chooses.  Each function should
#    return either true or false so that the appropriate next state may be
#    chosen.
#.P
#    The chief benefit of using <a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/c/fsa/contents/fsm.awk">fsm.awk</a> 
#	is easy to read, consistent state
#    machine specifications and reuse of existing, tested code.  Multiple
#    tables and multiple users are happily accommodated. It's not hi-tech,
#    but in provides an easy avenue to generalization and consistency where
#    fsms are required.
#.P
#    This distribution represents a rewrite of an earlier version written
#    many years ago - rewritten with newer versions of awk and gcc in mind.
#    Consequently, it has not been tested using other compiler suites.
#    There are no known bugs, but, it IS a rewrite. 
#.P
#    Although a good candidate for C++, C was used because C++ was not being
#    used in any of the systems currently using fsm-gen.  Maybe a C++ version
#    will be in a subsequent release.
#.H2 Building the Sample FSM
#.P
#    The distribution provides the following files:
# .PRE
#COPYING and      FSF licenses
#COPYING.LESSER
#filelist         the "packing list"
#fsm.awk          the code generator
#fsm.c            the context and transition code
#fsm.h            definitions for the API
#makefile         simple makefile for the test driver code
#utils.h          error and utility definitions
#test.fsm         a sample fsm specification named "test"
#test_actions.c   action functions for the sample
#./PRE
#.P
#To build the sample,
#.OL
#.LI
#Download the
#.URL  http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/c/fsa/contents.zip .zip
#.LI
# extract the files from the zip - unzip contents.zip
#.LI
# build the example fsm - ./fsm.awk test.fsm
#            This step will produce fsm_test.c and fsm_test.h.
#.LI
#compile and link the executable (test) using make
#.LI
#run the sample - the executable produced by the
#            makefile is "test".  See the section <em>THE EXAMPLE FSM</em>
#            below for information on using the example.
#.P
#    When fsm.awk is run, (run via fsm.awk fsmName.fsm) it produces two
#    files, fsm_fsmName.c and fsm_fsmName.h.  Fsm_fsmName.c will contain
#    an array of struct fsm_s tagged as fsm_fsmName, eg.,
#<pre>
#struct fsm_s fsm_fsmName [STATES_COUNT][EVENTS_COUNT].
#</pre>
#.P
#    In the fsm distribution, the files fsm_test.c, fsm_test.h and
#    test_actions.c may be built as an executable sample.
#.P
#    The file fsm.c should be compiled and linked with the final executable 
#    as it contains the C code necessary to read the generated tables and 
#    update context.  
#. P
#    Building the example should compile error free with the exception of
#    a warning about using "gets()" in the sample driver.  Hey - it's just
#    a driver for a test.
#
#.H2 Example FSM Specification File
#.P
#    In its purist form, a fsm specifies state, event, action, new state.
#    For example, a rudimentary ftp server might be specified as follows:
#.PRE
## current     event     action          next 
## state                                  state
## --------------+----------+---------------+------------
#IDLE            CONN_REQ   makeConnection  CONNECTED
#CONNECTED       GET_REQ    sendBuffer      SENDING
#SENDING         FILE_SENT  closeFile       IDLE
#./PRE
#.P
#    It is useful on occasion to make the next state depend on the success
#    or failure of the action function.  Here, "ok" and "fail" mean "true"
#    and "false", respectively.  For example, as each buffer is sent
#    it would be useful to specify a different state if sendFile() returns
#    fail (indicating EOF).
#.PRE
## current     event     action     next         next 
## state                             state        state
##                                    ok           fail
## --------------+----------+----------+---------+-----
#CONNECTED       GET_REQ    sendBuffer SENDING   IDLE
#./PRE
#.P
#    State, event, action, and new state may be specified according to the
#    same rules as C variables/functions.  In the above table, the words
#    CONNECTED, GET_REQ, SENDING, and IDLE are used to generate #defines, 
#    and the action sendBuffer is the name of a user supplied function.
#
#.P The file test.fsm illustrates several idioms:
#.UL
#.LI
#         an event may be a single event or a comma separated list of 
#            events that all result in the same action and same next state.
#            For example, the specification
#.PRE
## current     event     action     next         next 
## state                             state        state
##                                    ok           fail
## --------------+----------+----------+---------+-----
#S1              EVENT_1    action_1   S2        S3
#./PRE
#.P            means, when receiving event EVENT_1 or EVENT_2 in state S1,
#            execute action action_1 and go to state S2 if the return value
#            of action_1() is true; go to state S3 if the return value of
#            action_1 is false.
#.LI
#         note that all events must be specified for each state.  See the
#            example specification file, test.fsm.
#.LI
#         an action specified as "-" means, "do nothing".  fsm.awk will
#            generate a NULL in the state transition tables which will 
#            be treated as "do nothing".  When so specified, the next state
#            will always be the next-state-ok state.
#.LI
#         an action specified as fsm_invalid_event will call the function
#            fsm_invalid_event(void) which always returns false.  This 
#            function may be edited to suit the situation at hand.  When
#            fsm_invalid_event is specified, the next state (both) may be 
#            left unspecified - fsm.awk will generate next state information
#            as being the current state (ie., no change in the current state).
#.lI
#         a fail next state specified as "-" means the fail next state is 
#            the same as the success next state.  That is, in the specification
#.PRE
## current     event     action     next         next 
## state                             state        state
##                                    ok           fail
## --------------+----------+----------+---------+-----
#S1              EVENT_1    action_1   S2        -
#./PRE
#            means, when receiving event EVENT_1 in state S1, execute action
#            action_1 and go to state S2 irrespective of the return value of 
#            action_1().
#./UL
#.H2 The Example FSM
#.P
#    Included in the distribution are test.fsm and test_actions.c which
#    implement a very simple state machine called "test".  After the
#    executable "test" is produced (via make), it may be used to show the
#    behavior of the fsm.
#.P
#    The example fsm was built and tested with gcc version 4.0.2 and awk
#    version 3.1.4.
#
#.h2 Example Output from the Sample
#.P
#      On running "test", first the line "testing fsm test" is printed, then a
#    line indicating the initial state.  It then asks for the next event.
#    All events in the example are the lowercase letters 'a' thru 'd',
#    entered from the keyboard. A special event 'z' will cause the trace to
#    be dumped.  Entering 'q' will cause test to exit.  Note that to keep
#    the example simple, other than special events 'z' and 'q', there is no
#    checking of input for being outside the known set of events.  A sample
#    session might look like this:
#.PRE
#$>
#$> ./test
#testing fsm test
#
#starting in state 1
#next event: a
#got a (0)  ----> called fsm_s2_ab ----> ,went to state 0
#next event: d
#got d (3)  ----> invalid eventwent to state 0
#next event: b
#got b (1)  ----> called fsm_s1_b ----> ,went to state 1
#next event: c
#got c (2)  ----> went to state 1
#next event: z
#trace index is 4
#event      state
#0          0
#3          0
#1          1
#2          1
#0          0 <-- next/oldest
#0          0
#0          0
#0          0
#
#next event: q
#bye
