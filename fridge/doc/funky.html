<h1><join>Funky: Functional Gawk</join></h1>
<p>
These pages are focused on <u>Fun</u>ctional  Gaw<u>k</u> (a.k.a.
"Funky").
<p>Funky is enabled by a new feature added to Gawk 3.1.7: indirect functions.
For example:
<pre>
function foo() { print "foo" }
function bar() { print "bar" }

BEGIN {
                the_func = "foo"
                @the_func()     # calls foo()
                the_func = "bar"
                @the_func()     # calls bar()
}
</pre>
<p>At the time of this writing, Gawk 3.1.7 is pre-release
and indirect functions can be accessed using the
 3.1.6 development branch:
<pre>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/sources/gawk co gawk-devel
</pre>
