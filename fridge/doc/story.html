<P>
This code inputs a set of productions 
and outputs a string of words that satisfy the production rules.
<P>
This page describes two versions of that system: 
<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/lib/awk/grammar/story.awk">story.awk</a>
and
<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/lib/awk/grammar/storyp.awk">storyp.awk</a>.
The former selects productions at random with equal probability. The latter
allows the user to bias the selection by adding weights at the end  of line, after
each production. 
<a name=4></a><H2> Options</H2>
<DL>
<DT> -v Grammer=FILE ]</DT>
<DD> Sets the FILE containing the productions. Defaults to "grammar".</DD>
<DT> -v Seed=NUM</DT>
<DD>
 Sets the seed for the random number generator. Defaults to "1". 
A useful idiom for generating random text is to use <em> Seed=$RANDOM</em>

 A Few And Leave

 Are Not radioactive and can not be killed by the Navy but They Die
 From Catching A Cold

<a name=8></a><H3> Biasing the Story</H3>
<P>
Here is a grammar suitable for storyp.awk. Note that number at end of line that biases how often a
production is selected. For example, "runs" and "slowly" are nine times more likely than other Verbs
 and Adverbs.
<pre>
Sentence -> Nounphrase Verbphrase   1
Nounphrase -> the boy               0.75
Nounphrase -> the girl              0.25
Verbphrase -> Verb Modlist Adverb   1
Verb -> runs                        0.9
Verb -> walks                       0.1
Modlist ->                          0.5
Modlist -> very Modlist             0.5
Adverb -> quickly                   0.1
Adverb -> slowly                    0.9
</pre>
The following code executes the biases story generation:
<pre>
for((i=1;i&lt;=10;i++)); do echo Sentence ;  done |
gawk -f ../storyp.awk -v Grammar=englishp.rules 
</pre>
<P>
This produces the following output. Note that, usually, we run slowly.
<pre>
the boy runs very slowly 
the boy runs slowly 
the girl runs very slowly 
the boy runs slowly 
the boy runs slowly 
the girl walks very slowly 
the boy walks slowly 
the girl runs slowly 
the boy runs slowly 
the boy runs slowly

 Storyp.awk is almost the same as story.awk but it is assumed that each line ends in a number
 that will bias how often that production gets selected.

The code comes from 
Alfred Aho, Brian  Kernighan, and Peter  Weinberger from the 
 book "The AWK Programming Language",
Addison-Wesley, 1988.

The scifi grammar was written by Tim Menzies, 2009, based on 
one from 
"The Science Fiction Horror Movie Pocket Computer" by Gahan Wilson,
( in "The Year's Best Science Fiction No. 5", edited by
Harry Harrison and Brian Aldiss, Sphere, London, 1972).
