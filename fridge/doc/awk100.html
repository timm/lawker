<h1><join>The Awk 100</join></h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Awk is being used all around the world for real programming problems,
 but the news is not getting out. 

<p>We are aiming to create a database of at least one hundred Awk programs which will:

<ul>
<li>Identify the tasks that Awk is really being used for
<li>Enable analysis of the benefits of the language for practical programming
<li>Serve as an information exchange for applications
</ul>

<h2>Contribute</h2>

<p>If you, or your colleagues or friends have 
written a program which has been used for purposes small or large, 
why not take five minutes to record the facts, so that others can see what you've done?
<p>To contribute, fill in this <a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/doc/awk100/template.txt">template</a>
and mail it to <a href="mailto:mail@awk.info?subject=Awk 100 contribution">mail@awk.info</a> with the subject line <em>Awk 100 contribution</em>.

<li value="21.">Dan at sourceforge's    <a href="http://awk.info/?jawk">Jawk</a> system:
<ul>
<li>
Awk, impelemeneted in the Java virtual machine. Very useful for extending lightweight scripting in Awk with (e.g.) network and GUI facilities from Java.
</ul>


<li value="20.">Axel T. Schreiner's   <a href="http://awk.info/?dsl/ooc">OOC</a> system:
<ul>
<li>
ooc is an awk program which reads class descriptions and performs the routine coding tasks necessary to do object-oriented coding in ANSI C. 
</ul>


<li value="19.">Ladd and Raming's  <a href="http://awk.info/?awkastar">Awk A-star</a> system:
<ul>
<li>
Programmers often take awk "as is", never thinking to use it as a lab in which we can explore other language extensions. This is of course, only one way to treat the Awk code base.

An alternate approach is to treat the Awk code base as a reusable library of parsers, regular expression engines, etc etc and to make modifications to the lanugage. This second approach was take by David Ladd and J. Christopher Raming in their A* system. 
</ul>

<li value="18.">Henry Spencer's <a href="http://awk.info/?aasl">Amazing Awk Syntax Language</a> system:
<ul>
<li>

Aaslg and aaslr implement the Amazing Awk Syntax Language, AASL
(pro- nounced ``hassle''). Aaslg (pronounced ``hassling'') takes
an AASL specification from the concatenation of the file(s) (default
standard input) and emits the corresponding AASL table on standard
output. 
<li>
The AASL implementation is not large. The scanner is 78 lines of
awk,the parser is 61 lines of AASL (using a fairly low-density
paragraphing style and a good manycomments), and the semantics pass
is 290 lines of awk. The table interpreter is 340 lines, about half
of which (and most of the complexity) can be attributed to the
automatic error recovery.
<li>
As an experiment with a more ambitious AASL specification, one for
ANSI C was written. This occupies 374 lines excluding comments and
blank lines, and with the exception of the messy details of
C declarators is mostly a fairly straightforward transcription of the
syntax given in the ANSI standard. 
</ul>


<li value="17.">Jurgen Kahrs (and others) 
 <a href="http://awk.info/?awk100/017xmlgawk">XMLgawk</a> system:
<ul>
<li>
 XMLgawk is an experimental extension of the GNU Awk interpreter. It includes a small XML parsing library which is built upon the Expat XML parser.
<li>
The same tool that can load the XML shared library can also add other libraries (e.g. PostgreSQL).
</ul>

<li value="16.">Henry Spencer's
 <a href="http://awk.info/?awk100/aaa">Amazing Awk Assembler</a>
<ul>
<li>
"aaa" (the Amazing Awk Assembler) is a primitive assembler written entirely
 in awk and sed.  It was done for fun, to establish whether it was possible.
 It is; it works.  
 Using "aaa", it's very easy to adapt to a new machine, provided the machine
 falls into the generic "8-bit-micro" category.  
</ul>
<li value="15.">Ronald  Loui's 
 <a href="?awk100/015soccer">AI programming lab</a>.
<ul>
<li>

For many years, Ronald Loui has taugh AI using Awk. He writes: 
<ul>
<li>Most
people are surprised when I tell them what language we use in our
undergraduate AI programming class. That's understandable. We use
GAWK. 
<li>
 A repeated observation in this class is that only the scripting
 programmers can generate code fast enough to keep up with the
 demands of the class. Even though students
     were allowed to choose any language they wanted, and many had
    to unlearn the Java ways of doing things in order to benefit
    from scripting, there were few who could develop ideas into
    code effectively and rapidly without scripting.
<li>
What I have found not only surprising but also hopeful, is that
when I have approached the AI people who still enjoy
 programming, some of them are not the least bit
surprised.
</ul>
</ul>



<li value="14.">Henry Spencer's
 <a href="?tools/awf">Amazing Awk Formatter</a>.
<ul>
<li>
Awf may not be lightning fast,  and it  has certain restrictions, but it does a decent job on most manual pages and simple -ms documents, and isn't subject to AT&T's brain-damaged licensing that denies many System V users any text formatter at all. It is also a text formatter that is simple enough to be tinkered with, for people who want to experiment. 
</ul>



<li value="13.">Yung-Pin Cheng's
 <a href="?awk100/013awklinux">Awk-Linux Course ware</a>.
<ul>
<li>
The stable and cross-platform nature of Awk enabled the simple creation of a robust toolkit for teaching operating system concepts to university
students.  The toolkit is much simpler/ easier to port to new platforms, than alternative and more 
elaborate course ware tools. 
<li>This work was the basis for a quite prestigious publication in the IEEE  Transactions on Education journal, 2008, Vol 51, Issue 4. Who said
Awk was an old-fashioned tool?
</ul>


<li value="12.">Jon Bentley's 
 <a href="?tools/m1">m1 micro macro processor</a>.
<ul>
<li>
Supports the essential operations of defining strings and replacing strings in text by their definitions.
All in 110 lines. 
A little awk goes a long way.
