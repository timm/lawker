I was lurking around on twitter during my lunch hour (yes, even freelancers need a lunch hour), and @bitprophet tweeted thusly:
<ul>
    <em>Get syslog-owned log names from syslog.conf: </em>
<pre>grep -v "^#" syslog.conf | 
awk "{print $2}" | egrep -v "^(\*|\|)" | 
sed "/^$/ d" | sed "s/^-//"
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
Followed by this:
<ul><p>
    <em>Interested to see if anyone can shorten my previous tweet's command line, 
outside of using 'cut' instead of the awk bit.)
</em>
</ul>
<p>
I happen to love puzzles like this, and my lunch was almost immediately followed by a long, boring conference call.
<p>
@bitprophet's pipeline above is translated by my brain into the English:
</pre
<ul>
<p>
    <em>Find non-commented lines, grab the second space-delimited field, 
then filter out the ones that start with "*" or "|", then delete any blank lines, and strip any leading "-" from the result.
</em>
</ul>
<p>
My brain usually attempts to think of the English version of the solution *first*, and then try to emulate that in the code/command I write. So, the issue here is we want to find file paths (and apparently sockets are ok, too, as "@" is a valid leading character in the initial definition of the problem). If it's a file path, we want to see it in a form that would be suitable for passing it to something like "ls -l", which means leading symbols like "-" and "|" should be omitted.
<p>
In a syslog.conf file, the main meat is the area where you specify the warning levels, and the file you want messages at that warning level sent to (this is a simplistic explanation, but good enough to understand the solution I came up with). The file is also littered with comments. Here's the file on my Mac:
<small><pre>
*.err;kern.*;auth.notice;authpriv,remoteauth,install.none;mail.crit        /dev/console
*.notice;authpriv,remoteauth,ftp,install.none;kern.debug;mail.crit    /var/log/system.log

# Send messages normally sent to the console also to the serial port.
# To stop messages from being sent out the serial port, comment out this line.
#*.err;kern.*;auth.notice;authpriv,remoteauth.none;mail.crit        /dev/tty.serial

# The authpriv log file should be restricted access; these
# messages shouldn't go to terminals or publically-readable
# files.
auth.info;authpriv.*;remoteauth.crit            /var/log/secure.log

lpr.info                        /var/log/lpr.log
mail.*                            /var/log/mail.log
ftp.*                            /var/log/ftp.log

install.*                        /var/log/install.log
install.*                        @127.0.0.1:32376
local0.*                        /var/log/appfirewall.log
local1.*                        /var/log/ipfw.log
stuff.*                            -/boo
things.*                        |/var/log
*.emerg                            *
</pre></small>
<p>So, in English, my brain parses the problem like this:
<ul><p><em>
    Skip blank lines, commented lines, and lines where the file name is "*", and give me everything else, but strip off characters "-" and 
"|" before sending it to the screen.
</em>
</ul>
<p>
And here's my awk one-liner for doing that:
<pre>
awk '$0 !~ /^$|^#/ && $2 !~ /^\*/ {sub(/^-|^\|/,"",$2);print $2}' syslog.conf
</pre>
<P>
Knowing a few key things about awk will help parse the above:
<p>
Awk automatically breaks up each line of input into fields. If you don't tell it what to use as a delimiter, it'll just use any number of spaces as the delimiter. If you have a CSV file, you'd likely use "awk -F," to tell awk to use a comma. For /etc/passwd, use "awk -F:". From there, you can reference the first field as $1, the second as $2, etc. $0 represents the whole line. There are more, but that's enough for this example.
<p>
Though I think most sysadmins can get a lot done with simple usage like "awk -F: '{print $2}'", sometimes more power is needed, and awk delivers. It uses the basic regex engine, and enables you to check a field (or the whole line: $0, like I do above) against a regex as a precondition for performing some action with the line or a field on that line. So, in the above awk command, I check to see if the line is either empty, or a comment. I then use a logical AND to check if field 2 starts with "*". If the current line is a match for any of these rules it is skipped.
<p>
Another nice thing about awk is that it actually is a Turing-complete programming language. After I check the lines of input against the rules mentioned above, I immediately know that I definitely want at least some portion of $2 in the remaining lines. What I *don't* want are preceding characters like "-" or "|". I need to strip them from the file name. I use awk's built in "sub()" function to handle that, and with that out of the way I call "print" to send the result to the screen.
