<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
SPAWK is an elegant collection of functions for accessing and
updating MySQL databases from within GNU awk programs. The SPAWK
module consists of a single awk extension library, namely libspawk.so,
which may be loaded in awk programs using the standard extension
awk function:

<pre>
BEGIN {
   extension("libspawk.so", "dlload")
   ...
</pre>
<p>
You can read or download some examples, or download the library and
write your own awk programs. A thread-safe library is also available
under the libspawk_r.so  tag.
<h2>A Short Example</h2>
<p>
Here's a short example of using SPAWK (for more details, see 
<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/spawkinfo/Home/manual">http://sites.google.com/site/spawkinfo/Home/manual</a>).
<p>

When calling <em>spawk_select</em>, SPAWK sends the query already given
(maybe some <em>spawk_query</em> calls preceeded the <em>spawk_select</em>) to the
current server (remind you that "server" in SPAWK's point of view
is a connection to the actual MySQL server mysqld). After calling
<em>spawk_select</em>, the server is ready to return the results to the awk
process via <em>spawk_data</em>, <em>spawk_first</em> or <em>spawk_last</em> calls. Alternatively,
at any time we can clear the results' set and release the server
with a <em>spawk_clear</em> function call.  <p>

The main data receiver is <em>spawk_data</em> function. This function is
usually called with one or two arguments. The first argument is an
array to be used as a data transfer vehicle, while the second
argument may be used optionally to hold the null valued columns.
<em>spawk_data</em> returns the number of columns of each returned data row
or zero if there are no more data to return (EOD). <em>spawk_first</em>
function's arguments and return values are exactly the same as those
of <em>spawk_data</em> arguments and returns values, but the rest of the
data will be lost, that is get the next available data row and
release the server. Similar is the <em>spawk_last</em> function, but the row
returned is the last row of the results' set. By the way, the
<em>spawk_last</em> function is less efficient than <em>spawk_first</em>; actually,
there is no particular reason to call spawk_last at all! Let's see
some examples:

<pre>
    BEGIN {
        extension("libspawk.so", "dlload")
        SPAWKINFO["database"] = "information_schema"
        spawk_select("SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME FROM TABLES")
        while (spawk_data(data))
            print data[0]

        exit(0)
    }
</pre>
<p>
Things need to be explained:
<ul>
    <li> extension is used to load the SPAWK module.
    <li> SPAWKINFO array is used to specify the default database (schema) to connect. Index "database" denotes default database.
    <li> <em>spawk_select</em> is used to execute the desired query.
    <li> <em>spawk_data</em> is used repeatedly to get the results, row by row. 
<em>spawk_data</em> returns 2 as there are results to be retuned and 0 on EOD.
</ul>
