 This command is platform independent and sends the translated program to standard

In this new version:
<UL>
<LI> The code no longer needs a shell script or batch file to launch awkpp</LI>
<LI> Multiple inheritance improved</LI>
<LI> added configuration items at the top of the program</LI>

<a name=3></a><H2> Description</H2>

<P>
 Awk++ is a <em>preprocessor</em>, that is it reads in a program written in
 the awk++ language and outputs a new program. 
  However, it's
 different than <em>awka</em>. The output from the awk++ preprocessor is awk code, not C
 or an executable program. So, some version of AWK, such as awk or gawk, has
 to be used to run the preprocessed program. <em>awka</em> can be used, in a second step,
 to turn the preprocessed awk++ program into an executable, if desired.

<a name=4></a><H3> OO in AWK++</H3>
<P>
 The awk++ language provides object oriented programming for AWK that includes:
<UL>
<LI> classes</LI>
<LI> class properties (persistent object variables)</LI>
<LI> methods</LI>
<LI> inheritance, including multiple inheritance</LI>
</UL>

<P> Awk++ adds new keywords to standard Awk:</P>
<UL>
<LI> class</LI>
<LI> method</LI>
<LI> prop</LI>
<LI> property</LI>
<LI> attr</LI>
<LI> attribute</LI>
<LI> elem</LI>
<LI> element</LI>
<LI> var</LI>
<LI> variable</LI>
</UL>

<a name=5></a><H3> Syntax</H3>

<a name=6></a><H4> Samples:</H4>

<PRE>
 a = class1.new[(optional parameters)] *** similar to Ruby
 b = a.get("aProperty")
 a.delete

 class class1 {
 property aProperty
 method new([optional parameters]) {
 # put initialization stuff here
 }

 method get(propName) {
 if(propName = "aProperty")
 return aProperty ### Note the use of 'return'. It behaves
 ### exactly the same as in an AWK function.
 }
 }
</PRE>

<a name=7></a><H4> Details</H4>

<P> To define a class (similar to C++ but no public/private):</P>
<PRE>
class class_name {.....}
</PRE>

<P> To define a class with inheritance:</P>
<PRE>
class class_name : inherited_class_name [ : inherited_class_name...] {.....}
</PRE>

<P> To add local/private variables (persistent variables; syntax is unique to awk++):</P>
<PRE>
class class_name {
 attribute|attr|property|prop|element|elem|variable|var variable_name
 ..... }
</PRE>
<P>
 To help programmers who are used to other OO languages, "attribute",
 "property", "element", and "variable", along with their 4-letter abbreviations,
 are interchangeable.
<P>
 Note: these persistent variables cannot be accessed directly. The programmer
 must define method(s) to return them, if their values are to be made available
 to code that's outside the class.

<P>
To add methods
<PRE>
class class_name {
 attribute variable_name1

 method method_name(parameters) {
 ...any awk code....
 }
 ..other method definitions...
 }
</PRE>
<P>
To create an object
<PRE>
 object_variable = class_name.new[(optional parameters)]
</PRE>
(runs the method named "new", if it exists; returns the object ID)


<P>
To call an object method
<PRE>
object_variable.method_name(parameters)
</PRE>
<P>
 The dot isn't used for concatenation in awk/gawk, so it's a natural choice
 for the separator between the object and method.

<P>
 To reclaim the memory used by an object, use the delete method, i.e.:
<PRE>
object_variable.delete
</PRE>
<P>
 but don't define delete() in your classes. awk++ recognizes delete() as a special
 method and will take care of deleting the object. Deleting objects is
 only necessary, though, if they hold a lot of
 data. Overhead for objects themselves is insignificant.

<a name=8></a><H4> Naming and behavior rules:</H4>
<UL>
<LI> Class names must obey the same rules as user defined function names.</LI>
<LI> Method names must follow the same rules as AWK user defined function names.</LI>
<LI> Class "local" variables (properties, attributes, etc.) must follow the same</LI>
 naming rules as AWK variables.
<LI> Objects are number variables, so they must obey number variable rules. However,</LI>
 the values in variables holding objects should never be changed, as they are
 simply identifiers. Performing math operations on them is meaningless.
</UL>

<a name=9></a><H4> Syntax notes</H4>
<P>
 OO syntax goals:
<UL>
<LI> easy to parse and match to awk code using an awk program as the "preprocessor"</LI>
<LI> easy to understand</LI>
<LI> easy to remember</LI>
<LI> easy and fast to type</LI>
<lI> distinct from existing AWK syntax</lI>
</UL>
<P>
 The OO syntax is based partly on C++, partly on Javascript, partly on Ruby and
 partly on the book "The Object-Oriented Thought Process". It isn't lifted in
 toto from one langauage because other languages provide features that gawk can't
 accomplish or have syntax that is hard to parse.

<a name=10></a><H3> Multiple Inheritance</H3>
<P>
In awk++, if a method is called that isn't in the object's class and there
are inherited classes (superclasses) specified, the inherited classes are called
in left to right order until one of them returns a value. That value
becomes the result of the method call.
This is the way awk++ resolves the
<em>diamond</em> problem. As a programmer, you control the sequence in which
superclasses are called by the left to
right order of the list of inherited classes in the class definition. 
<P>
There are two important things to note.
<OL>
<LI> The search will proceed up through as many ancestors as it takes to find a matching method.</LI>
<LI> A "match" is made when a value is returned. If a superclass has a matching</LI>
method that returns nothing, the search will continue. Thus, it's possible that
more than one method could be executed resulting in unintended
consequences. Be careful!
</OL>
<P>
 Calls to undefined methods do nothing and return nothing, silently.

<a name=11></a><H2> Running awk++</H2>
<P>
The command to preprocess an awk++ program looks like this:
<PRE>
gawk -f awkpp file-name-of-awk++-program
</PRE>
or, if the "she-bang" line (line 1 in awkpp) has the right path to gawk, and awkpp is executable and in a directory in PATH,
<PRE>
awkpp file-name-of-awk++-program
</PRE>
To run the output program immediately,
<PRE>
gawk -f awkpp -r file-name-of-awk++-program [awk options] data-files-to-be-processed
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
awkpp -r file-name-of-awk++-program [awk options] data-files-to-be-processed
</PRE>
When running an awk++ program immediately, standard input (stdin) cannot be
used for data. One or more data file paths must be listed on the command line.

<a name=12></a><H2> Bugs</H2>
<P>
There is a bug in the standard AWK distributions that affects the preprocessor.
Additionally, the preprocessor uses the 3rd array option of the match() function.
 So, it's best to use GAWK to run the preprocessor.
<P>
 On the other hand, the AWK code created by translating awk++ is intended
 to work with all versions of AWK. If you find otherwise, please notify the
 developer(s).
