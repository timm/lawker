<h2>About</h2>
<p>
 runawk is a small wrapper for the AWK interpreter that helps one
   write standalone AWK scripts. Its main feature is to provide a
   module/library system for AWK which is somewhat similar to Perl's
   "use" command. It also allows you to select a preferred AWK
   interpreter and to setup the environment for your scripts. It also
   provides other helpful features, for example it includes
   numerous useful of modules.
