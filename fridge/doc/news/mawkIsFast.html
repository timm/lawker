When one of these new fangled 'Big Data' sets comes your way, the
very first thing you have to do is data munging: shuffling around
file formats, renaming fields and the like. Once you're dealing
with hundreds of megabytes of data, even simple operations can take
plenty of time.
<p>
For one recent ad-hoc task I had -  reformatting 1GB of textual feature data into a form Matlab and R can read - I tried writing implementations in several languages, with help from my classmate Elijah.

<p>
To be clear,  the problem is to take several files of (item name, feature name, value) triples, like:
<pre>
000794107-10-K-19960401 limited 1
000794107-10-K-19960401 colleges 1
000794107-10-K-19960401 code 2
...
004334108-10-K-19961230 recognition 1
004334108-10-K-19961230 gross 8
...
</pre>
And then rename items and features into sequential numbers as a sparse matrix: (i, j, value) triples. Items should count up from inside each file; but features should be shared across files, so they need a shared counter. Finally, we need to write a mapping of feature IDs back to their names for later inspection; this can just be a list.
<p>
Since it's a standardized language, many implementations exist. One of them, MAWK, is incredibly efficient. It outperforms all other languages, including statically typed compiled ones like Java and C++! It wins on both LOC and performance criteria- a rare feat indeed, transcending the usual competition of slow-but-easy scripting languages versus fast-but-hard compiled languages.
<p>
All the code, results, and data can be obtained at

Editor's note: one reply to this blog entry by Eric Young optimized  Brendan's Ruby solution  and
re-ran all the tests. Eric reported these runtimes:
<pre>
33.8s mawk
36.3s gcc c
51.0s java
67.0s perl Fletch.pl
71.7s python
87.8s perl
95.8s nawk
101.4s gawk
114.0s gcc
133.0s ruby1.9 eay.rb
136.8s ruby1.8 eay.rb
327.6s ruby1.8
372.9s ruby1.9
</pre>
<p>Note that Eric's results were the same as Brendan's: mawk beats all.
