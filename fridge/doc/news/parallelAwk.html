 Parallel Awk is an effort to link Awk with MPI,
enabling the everyday analysis of large plain-text files to be parallelized,
allowing rapid prototyping of parallel applications,
preserving the syntax and style of Awk,
and hiding the details of MPI.

<h2> Awk and MPI</h2>


<p>The Awk programming language, first developed at Bell Labs in
1977, is a standard part of Unix operating system distributions.
It is a compact language, commonly used in systems administration
and in commercial (as opposed to scientific) computing. The half
dozen books about awk include the original slim and very readable
Awk book by Aho, Kernighan, and Weinberger. Awk is standardized in
POSIX, and the most actively maintained current implementation is
GNU awk. While awk, like sed, is perhaps most often used for
"one-liners," its regular expression handling and rich C-like syntax
make it well-suited for many small applications and domain-specific
languages.  <p> MPI is a standard Message Passing Interface for
parallel computing created by the MPI Forum, implemented in two
widely-used free distributions (LAM/MPI and MPICH) and in optimized
versions provided by many hardware vendors. MPI libraries are often
linked with Fortran or C code in scientific computing tasks, such
as matrix calculations, and run on supercomputers or Beowulf clusters.
For some of these applications, runtime is actually greater than
development time; nonetheless, a language for rapid prototyping is
a handy tool to have around.

<h2>Example: Calculating Pi</h2>
<pre>
# pi.awk: approximate pi by integrating f(x) = 4/(1+x^2)
# n = number of intervals to calculate 
#
# e.g.: mpiexec -n 4 mpawk -v n=10000 -f pi.awk 

BEGIN {
    h = 1/n
    for(i = RANK+1 ; i <= n ; i += SIZE) {
        x = h * (i - 0.5)
        sum +=  4 / (1 + x^2)
    }
    pi = reduce(sum(h * sum))
    if(!RANK) printf("n=%d, pi is %1.20f\n",n,pi)
}
</pre>
<p>
pi.awk requires about 20% as many lines of code as its equivalents in C or Fortran; 
being computationally intensive, it runs about 100 times slower. The output is printed by the process with RANK = 0 and looks like this:
<pre>
sh% mpiexec -n 4 mpawk -v n=100000 -f pi.awk
n=100000, pi is 3.14159265359811668006
</pre>

<h2>Status</h2>
<p>
The latest beta release of Parallel Awk is version 0.8. In this release, any Awk expression (including numbers, strings, and arrays) can be sent from one process to another using the functions send and recv. The comm_split() function, an interface to MPI_Comm_split, allows the creation of intra-communicators, while a companion function comm_set() is used to set the default MPI communicator implicitly used for all other MPI operations. Supported collective operations include reduce(), which can be applied to both numeric and string expressions, and barrier(). A function called assign() is used to divide the lines of input among the set of processes, as can a hash() function that is applied to array keys or other strings.
