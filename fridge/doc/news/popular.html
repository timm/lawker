<h1><join>Awk.info Gaining Popularity</join></h1>

<p>
<em>Nov 28, 2009</em>
<p>This site is moving up the page rankings:
<ul>
<li>Four months ago, typing "awk" into Google resulted in pages of output where the first mention of awk.info did not appear till half-way down page five.
<li>
Today, the same query finds "awk.info" on page two (in position 18). 
</ul>
<p>
Other indicators also look good. Since the site was launched (Feb 15, 2009), the number of visits 
has
been steadily increasing:

<p>
These 19,268 visits come from 2,765 cities from around the world:

Apart from Granville West Virginia (where this site is administrated),
the three cities with the most  visit are:
<ul>
<li>London, England (389 visits)
<li>Thessaloniki, Greece (491 visits)  
<li>Athens, Greece (640 visits). 
</ul>
<p>(BTW: Anyone got any ideas
why these cities visit here so often?)

In other news,
<a href="http://www.websiteoutlook.com/www.awk.info">Website Outlook</a>
reports that this site
is now worth
$1423.5 USD
and it promises a
daily ad revenue stream from awk.info
of	$1.95. 
<p>
To put that report in perspective, <a href="http://rottentomatoes.com">rottentomatoes.com</a> is worth
$3,300,000 with a daily revenue stream of $4523.19. So our travel plans to  Berumda will be a little
delayed this year.
