<h2>What is Awk?</h2>
<p> 
Awk is a stable, cross platform computer language named for its
authors
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/awkbook/">
Alfred Aho,
Peter  Weinberger &amp;
Brian Kernighan</a>. They write:
<em>
"Awk is a convenient and expressive programming language that can be
applied to a wide variety of computing and data-manipulation tasks".</em>
</em>
<p> 
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Classic-Shell-Scripting-Arnold-Robbins/dp/0596005954">Classic
Shell Scripting</a>, Arnold Robbins &amp; Nelson  Beebe confess their  Awk bias:
<em>
"We like it. A lot. 
The simplicity and power of
Awk often make it just the right tool for the
job."
</em>
<p>
Awk is a mature language- it was first implemented in the 1970s.
As a tool from the golden age, it is sometimes called <em>primitive</em>. 
It is more accurate to call it 
<a href="http://awk.info/?news/awkeye">elemental</a>, so tightly focused is the language on what it does best: 
quickly converting <em>this</em> into <em>that</em>.
<p>
Consequently, throughout history, Awk has been the language of choice for
many famous scientists such as 
<a href="http://awk.info/?news/davinci">Leonardo daVinci</a>.
