...even experienced Unix programmers often don't know awk, or know it but view it 
as a counterpart of sed: useful "glue" for sticking things together in shell programming, 
but quite unsuited for major programming tasks. This is a major underestimate of a very 
powerful tool, and has hampered the development of support software that would make 
awk much more useful. 
<p>There is no fundamental reason why awk programs have to be 
small "glue" programs: even the "old" awk is a powerful programming language in its 
own right. Effective use of its data structures and its stream-oriented structure takes some 
adjustment for C programmers, but the results can be quite striking. 
<p>On the other hand, 
getting there can be a bit painful, and improvements in both the language and its support 
tools would help.

 The paper is still interesting, although
 some bits are outdated (we now have a profiler, for instance).
