<h1><join>Awk: A Systems Programming Language?</join></h1>

<p>
In the 1980s Henry Spencer wrote in <a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/share/pdf/aasl.pdf">AwkAs A Major Systems Programming Language </a>:
that...
<ul>
...even experienced Unix programmers often don't know awk, or know it but view it 
as a counterpart of sed: useful "glue" for sticking things together in shell programming, 
but quite unsuited for major programming tasks. This is a major underestimate of a very 
powerful tool, and has hampered the development of support software that would make 
awk much more useful. There is no fundamental reason why awk programs have to be 
small "glue" programs: even the "old" awk is a powerful programming language in its 
own right. Effective use of its data structures and its stream-oriented structure takes some 
adjustment for C programmers, but the results can be quite striking. On the other hand, 
getting there can be a bit painful, and improvements in both the language and its support 
tools would help.

In 2009, Arnold Robbins comments:

 The paper is still interesting, although
 some bits are outdated (we now have a profiler, for instance).
