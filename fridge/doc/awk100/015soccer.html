<p>
<em>Ronald Loui writes</em>: Most people are surprised when I tell them what language we use in our undergraduate AI programming class. That's understandable. We use GAWK. GAWK, Gnu's version of Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan's old pattern scanning language

This code manages a CGI interface to a process that simulates a soccer game, polling for inputs from two student programs.

What I have found not only surprising but also hopeful, is that when I have approached the AI people who still enjoy
<h2> Awk </h2><p>

Was written for gawk in 1995 but should run on almost any awk dialect; some css positioning commands will not work in all browsers; try IE6.

<h2> Platform  </h2><p>

Was written on Redhat Linux with multiple hardware platforms in mind.

<h2> Uses </h2><p>

Intended to be run on close server to minimize delays.

<h2> Lines </h2><p>

605 lines in main cgi with several small aux control programs.

<h2> DevelopmentEffort </h2><p>
Minimal compared to development effort, but potentially will require css for new browsers.

<h2> MaintenanceEffort </h2> <p>

Number of person-months since, including enhancements

<h2> Current</h2> <p>

2=Evaluation.

<h2> Users </h2><p>

50 students in artificial intelligence project classes had to use some version of this code over seven years
