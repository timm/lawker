<h1><join>Awk100</join></h1>
<p> An <a href="http://awk.info/?awk100">Awk100</a> program.
<h2>Name</h2><p> Anne's Negotiation Game 
<h2>Purpose</h2><p> Research on a model of negotiation incorporating search, dialogue, and changing expectations
<h2>Source code</h2>
<p> See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/lawker/source/browse/#svn/fridge/gawk/awk100/negotiate">gawk/awk100/argcol</a>.
<h2>Developers</h2><p> Ronald Loui (programmer and designer), Anne Jump (adversary) 
<h2>Organization</h2><p> National Science Foundation grant at Washington University in St. Louis 
<h2>Country</h2><p> USA 
<h2>Domain</h2><p> Prototype of a new idea for cognitive modelling (in artificial intelligence/economics/organizational behavior)

<h2>Description</h2><p> Program generates a game board upon which players take turn searching or declaring according to a protocol.  It is based on the same game bimatrix made famous by people like von Neumann and Nash, but invents a new approach to negotiation based on process instead of solution.  
<h2>Awk</h2><p> Was written for gawk in 1997 but should run on almost any awk dialect
<h2>Platform</h2><p> Was written on Redhat Linux with multiple hardware platforms in mind 
<h2>Uses</h2><p> Was intended to be self-contained 
<h2>Lines</h2><p> 658 lines, of which 39 are comments 
<h2>DevelopmentEffort</h2><p> One day, 6-8 hours total 
<h2>MaintenanceEffort</h2><p> Two revisions are available, mainly to permit programs to negotiate instead of humans, and to provide a web-based dashboard to monitor the events 
<h2>CurrentStatus</h2><p> 2=Evaluation 
<h2>Use</h2><p> 2=in-House use 
<h2>Users</h2><p> 50 students in artificial intelligence project classes had to use some version of this code over three yeears 
<h2>DateDeployed</h2><p> October 1997 
<h2>Dated</h2><p> January 2008
