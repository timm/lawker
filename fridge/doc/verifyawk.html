<H2>Abstract</h2>
The goal of result-verification is to prove that one execution 
run of a program satisfies its specification. Compared 
with implementation-verification, 
result-verification has a 
larger scope for applications in practice, 
gives more opportunities for automation and, based on the execution record 
not the implementation, is particularly suitable for complex 
systems. 
<p>This paper proposes a technical framework to apply this technique 
in practice. We show how to write formal 
result-based specifications, how to generate a verifier program to check a given specification and 
to carry out result-verification according to the generated program. 
<p>The execution result is written as a text file, the verifier is written 
in AWK (special-purpose language for text processing) and 
verification is done automatically by the AWK interpreter; 
given the verifier and the execution result as inputs.

In this paper we propose a technical framework to carry 
out automated result-verification in practice.  
 Its main features are: 
<ul>
<Li>
The execution result is a simple text file. Many pro- 
grams produce such (log) files during their normal 
operations, for administrative purposes. A general 
technique to record exactly the information needed 
for verification, is to introduce a program wrapper. 
<li>
The execution result is given as input to the verifier 
program, which does the actual verification. Given 
the execution result in a text file, we consider result-verification as the text-processing task. Accordingly, 
the verifier is written in AWK, which is a special-purpose language for text processing, 
implemented for most computing platforms. Verification 
is done by the AWK interpreter, given the execution 
result and the verifier program as inputs. 
</ul>
