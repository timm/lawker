<h1> <join>Pretty Print AWK Code</join></h1>
<p>The code that renders the awk.info web site can "pretty print" awk code.  For example:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://awk.info/?gawk/array/join.awk">http://awk.info/?gawk/array/join.awk</a>
pretty
prints the Awk code found in
<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/gawk/array/join.awk">join.awk</a>.
</ul>
<p>To enable that pretty print, add some html syntax inside your
code and apply the following conventions.
<h2>Preview Engine</h2>
<p>Note that if you want to see your "looking pretty", then you could
could see how it looks using our preview tool:
<pre>
http://awk.info/?awk:urlWithoutHTTPprefix
</pre>
<p>For exmaple, the file <a href="http://menzies.us/tmp/xx.awk">http://menzies.us/tmp/xx.awk</a> 
can be previewed using
<a href="http://awk.info/?awk:menzies.us/tmp/xx.awk">http://awk.info/?awk:menzies.us/tmp/xx.awk</a> 

<h3>Contributing Pretty Code</h3>
<p>Once you've got it "looking pretty", please consider contributing that code to awk.info,
so our code library can grow. To do so, either email <a href="mailto:mail@awk.info">mail@awk.info</a>
with the URL of your pretty code or zip up the files and email them across.

<h2>HTML-based Commenting Conventions</h2>

<p> The first paragraph of the file will be ignored. Use this first para
for copyright notices or comments about down-in-the weeds trivia. Note: the
first para ends with one blank line.

<p>The next paragraph should start with 
<pre>#.H1 &lt;join>Title&lt;/join></pre>

<p> The code could should be topped and tailed as follows:
<pre>
#&lt;pre>
code
#&lt;/pre>
</pre>
<p> All other comment lines should start with a single "#" at front-of-line.
These comment characters will be stripped away by the awk.info renderer.
<p>Awk.info's renderer adopts the following html shorthand. If a line starts with
<pre>
#.WORD other words 
</pre>
<p>this this is replaced with
<pre>
&lt;WORD> other words&lt;/WORD>
</pre>
<p>If no <em>other words</em> follow <em>#.WORD</em> then the line becomes just <em>&lt;WORLD></em>
<p>Awk.info's renderer supports a few HTML extensions:
<ul>
<li><em>#.IN path</em> includes a file found in the LAWKER repositoriy at some <em>path</em> inside the trunk.
<li> <em>#.CODE path</em> includes the contents
of <em>path</em>, wrapped in  &ltpre> tags, and prefixed by the path.
<li> <em>#.BODY path</em> is the same as  <em>#.CODE</em> but it
skips the first paragraph (this is useful when the first paragraph includes tedious  details 
you want to hite from the user). 
<li>Note that, for <em>#.IN, #.CODE, #.BODY</em>, the <em>path</em> must appear after a single space.
</ul>
<p>
That's it. Now you can pretty print your code on the web just be adding
a little html in the comments.
