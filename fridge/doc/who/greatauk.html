<p>Some must lead and some must follow while others fix the typos.
<p>A <em>Great Auk</em>  is someone with write permission to 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/lawker/source/browse/">our repository</a>. Since the source for this web
site is stored in that repoistory, it also means that they are
webmasters of this site. So they (try) to:
<ol>
<li>
 keep the code and pages in a (somewhat) consistent form, 
<li>encourage code
documentation and test suites, 
<li>watch comp.lang.awk for cool stuff to add to this site, 
<li>write little demo programs, 
<li>handle
queries about this site, 
<li>work the issue reports, 
<li>etc.
</ol>

<p>If you want to be a  Great Auk, please start contributing to this site using any of the above methods. Once it is clear that you
know what you are doing and that you
play nice with others, then you should ask a current Great Auk to nominate you. Then, all the current Great Auks will vote about giving
your write access.
<p>The current Great Auks are
<ul>
<li><a href="http://awk.info/?who/jhart">Jim Hart</a>
<li><a href="http://awk.info/?who/timm">Tim Menzies</a>
</ul>
