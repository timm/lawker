<h1><join>A Tale of Two TAWKs</join></h1>
<p>In the Awk-verse, there are two TAWKs.

<p>TAWK #1 is <a href="http://www.tasoft.com/tawk.html">the TAWK Compiler</a> from Thompson Automation Software (no longer trading)
<ul>
<li>Is 100% compatible with Awk.
<li>Generates executable
<li>Comes with an interactive debugger
<li>In some test cases, code written 4 to 15 times faster runs as fast as "C", or better.
</ul>
<p>TAWK #2 was a <a href="http://www.ddj.com/architect/184408136">ultra-cut down version of AWK
 written in C++</a> by Bruce Eckel in 1989.
Eckel writes:
<ul>
<li>The program is called TAWK for "tiny awk," since the problem it solves is vaguely reminiscent of the "awk" pattern-matching language found on Unix (versions have also been created for DOS). 
<li>
It demonstrates one of the thornier problems in computer science: parsing and executing a 
programming language. 
<li>The data-encapsulation features of C++ prove most useful here, and a recursive-descent technique is used to read arbitrarily long fields and records. 
</ul>
